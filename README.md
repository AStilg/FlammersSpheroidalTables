# FlammersSpheroidalTables
This is a reproduction of the Tables in C. Flammer's book: <i>Spheroidal wave functions</i>. Tables are organsied into folders and individual files as I complete them. I do note that due to the limitations of the methods used at the time the original tables contain errors in accuracy. These tables (as far as I can determine) are correct.

These tables are only really useful as reference so that I could troubleshoot code I was working on, non-incidentally: [HARTT](https://github.com/AStilg/harttloose).
