# FlammersSpheroidalTables

This is a reproduction of the Tables in C. Flammer's book: <i>Spheroidal wave functions</i>. Tables are organsied into folders and individual files as I complete them. I do note that due to the limitations of the methods used at the time the original tables contain errors in accuracy. These tables (as far as I can determine) are correct.
